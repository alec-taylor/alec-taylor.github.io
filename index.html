<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>Welcome to my web site! I am 20 years old and a junior at the University of Maine.
 I previously studied Civil Engineering for three semesters before deciding
 to switch into the Maine Business School. Although I am still unsure what 
 I would like to do for a career I decided to enroll in an accounting major,
 while also thinking about a minor in finance. I am creating this website for 
 my Information Systems and Technology for Business course. Hopefully this
 will give you a brief insight into my life and who I am. </P>
