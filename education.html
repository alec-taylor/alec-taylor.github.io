<center><P>I graduated from Marshwood High School in 2015 in the top 15th percentile of my class.
All throughout middle and high school I was an honor or high honor roll student, getting mostly all A's
and B's. When I was a junior I took AP US History even though I had no interest in it which caused
me to do poorly on the AP exam for it. As a senior I took both AP Physics and Calculus and did average on 
both of those AP exams.</P></center>

<center><P>Although I was not quite sure what I wanted to do for a career once graduating high school, 
I knew it would be best for me to enroll in college, even if I regret it at times. Because I was always 
stronger in the math and science courses throughout school, I decided to study Civil Engineering at UMaine.
After three semesters of that I realized that it was not right for me and temporarily dropped out of school 
for the second semester of my sophmore year. Even with the lack of interest in the major, I was luckily able 
to maintain a 3.5 GPA over those three semesters. After taking a semester off from college, I decided I 
wanted to go back but could not decide what to study so I chose to study something in business because 
I can hopefully go anywhere with a business degree. I am currently in my first semester studying business 
and so far have been enjoying it. Below is a table of some of the courses I have taken throughout my college
career. </P></center>
