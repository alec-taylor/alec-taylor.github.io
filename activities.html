<center><P>Ever since I was a little kid I have enjoyed playing sports. My favorite by far is soccer which I started playing when I was 
three years old. Once I started I never stopped, playing through my childhood, into high school, and eventually playing intramural when 
I got to college. Although I've never been terribly good at it, I have still always loved playing it and watching it. I also played 
baseball, starting with tee ball when I was about four. I continued playing up until about when I was thirteen when I realized it was 
too slow and began playing lacrosse when I got to high school. I was not very good at lacrosse either though because I was too small. 
I tried wrestling when I was young but hated that and only did it for one year, only going to one of the many tournaments. I also played
basketball when I was in middle school before realizing it wasn't for me. Although I do no play an organized sports anymore I still enjoy 
kicking around a soccer ball, shooting around with a basketball, or tossing a football.</P></center>
