<center><H2>Clark's Bostonian</H2></center>
<center><P>At 16 I started working at a Clark's Bostonian Outlet, a retail job in the Kittery Premium Outlets.
I worked there for four years, mostly as a Sale's Associate but eventually became a Key Holder. My job there 
was mostly to assist customers with any help they needed as well as run the register. I was also responsible 
for maintaining a neat and organized store, as well as receiving and stocking any new products that came in. As
a key holder I was able to open and close the store by myself and take the money to the bank at the end of each day. 
Although it wasn't the greatest job, it did help me gain some insight about how retail businesses operate and teach me
how to be an efficient, effective, and responsible employee.</P></center>

<center><H3>Home Fashion Designs</H3></center>
<center><P>This past spring and summer I decided not to go back to Clark's and took a job in a warehouse for a company
called Home Fashion Designs. The company is an e-business that produces products in foreign countries, ships it to their
warehouses, and sells them online either to individual customers or other companies such as Amazon. My job there was to 
pick and pack orders that we received in order to be shipped, stock and maintain the inventory, keep the warehouse neat and clean,
as well as some other miscellaneous tasks. Again, this wasn't the most glamourous job but it did give me another perspective into
another side of the business world, seeing how e-businesses operate. As I began to study in business, it made me think about 
what I thought they did well and what I thought they could have done even better. Although I did not have the power to do much 
about changing what I thought didn't work. </P></center>
