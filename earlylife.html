<center><H1>Early Life</H1></center>
<center><P> I was born and raised in South Berwick, Maine to the parents of
Michael and Melissa with a brother,Luke, three years older than me. Although my parents
separated when I was a young child, I continued to live with my father in South Berwick 
and saw my mother frequently as she moved from place to place. Both of my parents ended up remarrying 
and both married someone with two sons so since then I have gained four step-brothers, three older, Tim, Zach, and Matt,
 and one younger, Josh, than me. At my father's house, we have one dog, Lola, who is a seven year old mutt we adopted when
she was a puppy. At my mother's house we have two cats, Katniss who is a few years old, and Flynn, who is still a kitten.
